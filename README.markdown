## 5 Usage ##

#### 5.1 @ Site builders ####

Attach `FL: Languages` datasource to your pages.

On Preferences page you can:

- `Site languages`: choose site languages
- `Main language`: choose the main language of the site

Important! When you change the language, re-install the detection driver `FLang detection gTLDs`.

#### 5.2 @ PHP developers ####

This extension provides a static [FLang class](https://github.com/vlad-ghita/frontend_localisation/blob/master/lib/class.flang.php) for easy access to Frontend language information.<br/>
If you want to create a third-party FLang detection driver, make sure that your driver adds the `fl-language` & `fl-region` params to the URL query string with appropriate values.
You can also set a main region value, but you need to edit the config.php file manually. Doing so will force you to use a driver that specify a region.
